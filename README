Jellyfin need CJK fonts to create some media post and subtitle etc. But it is not contained in the docker image provided.
One resolution is use linuxserver/jellyfin image and install it when init:
add environment vars in docker-compose:
```
    environment:
      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-package-install
      - INSTALL_PACKAGES=fonts-noto-cjk-extra
```
It will take a long time for installing.

This image is used to prebuild a linuxserver/jellyfin image that contain fonts-noto-cjk-extra. So the container env can have cjk fonts.
